Going by this, we realize we have as variables:
1. A grid, defined as 16 cells
2. A list of columns in the grid
3. A list of rows in the grid
4. A cell as defined by (x, y, z)
5. A list of possible values
6. A value for empty, perhaps 0 or 999999
7. A list of actions, right up down left
8. A list of the position of not-empty cells for each row
9. A list of the position of not-empty cells for each column
10. A boolean if the grid is full (if each row is full and each column is full)
11. A list of all opposite actions for the elimination of merged variables
